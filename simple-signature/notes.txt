Computing signature is done by m^d
To get signature of m, pick an r
m' = r^e * m
(m')^d = r * m^d
(m')^d * r^(-1) = m^d

Each time a message is inputted, a counter is added to the message before calculating signature, counter starts at 0
New message-signature pair at the end needs to account for counter

Alternate solution is to get signature of m, and then input m-1 for the new message using the same signature
